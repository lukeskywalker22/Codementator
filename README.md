# Codementator
Codementator is a helpful AI assistant to assist you while you code, either with friends or solo. The AI helps you add important comments to aid other collaborators in understanding your ~~incomprehensible~~ code. It can also be used to explain the code.

## Utilising it:
Copy and paste your code into the textbox, and select a coding language, select add or remove comments and tweak temperature.

## How it works:
Our code commentator makes use of GPT-3.5 to indepthly explain and annotate code. We access GPT-3.5 using Langchain.
